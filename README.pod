=head1 NAME

Couchbase::README - README for Couchbase::Client

=head1 Introduction

Couchbase is a Perl client for Couchbase (http://www.couchbase.org). This
I<replaces> the older L<Couchbase::Client>

Installing this module depends on the C<libcouchbase> library
(L<http://couchbase.com/communities/c>,
L<http://packages.couchbase.com/clients/c/index.html>). You must
have at least version I<2.4.2> installed. The library should exist in your
current compiler's search path (this is usually the case if you've used
the default installation methods). Inspect the C<author_utils/do_make.pl>
script in the source repository for ways to link against a custom install
prefix.


Using this library will mainly deal with the L<Couchbase::Bucket> class,
so have a look there!



=head2 SUPPORT

Support for this module is provided by the author. You can find him on
the C<#libcouchbase> IRC channel on the freenode network under the name
C<mnunberg> (number of trailing underscores may vary depending on his
network).

You can also try to file a bug in the github repository
(L<https://github.com/mnunberg/perl-Couchbase-Client>).


=head2 CONTRIBUTING


This module is primarily authored in XS. The C<xs> directory contains
the relevant C source code.


To run the tests you will need a copy of C<CouchbaseMock.jar> in the C<t/tmp>
directory. You may obtain this by glancing into the source code of libcouchbase
itself and downloading from the URL. Here's an example from the 2.4.2 version:
